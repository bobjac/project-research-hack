# Ansys SimAI and Agentic AI: Capabilities, Architecture, and Future Directions

## Introduction 
Ansys **SimAI** is a cloud-based simulation platform launched in early 2024 that combines high-fidelity physics simulation with generative AI to dramatically accelerate design analysis【41:1†source】. By leveraging deep learning surrogates, SimAI can predict a new design’s performance **in minutes instead of hours or days**, enabling 10×–100× faster evaluation cycles for complex engineering problems【41:1†source】,. This report examines SimAI’s capabilities and how they support emerging **“agentic AI”** development – i.e. autonomous AI agents that can reason and act within simulation-driven workflows. We also analyze the technology stack behind SimAI (using insights from AWS architecture descriptions and job postings) and propose an **optimal system architecture** for integrating AI agents with SimAI. An alternative **Microsoft Azure-only architecture** is provided for comparison. Finally, we discuss likely future extensions to the platform – including support for custom code generation, low-code user interfaces, and enhanced solution observability – and suggest methods to implement each. All findings are based on the latest resources (2024–2025), with dates included in citations for clarity.

## SimAI Capabilities and AI-Centered Possibilities 
**Ansys SimAI** (launched January 2024) is described as a physics-agnostic SaaS application that *“combines the predictive accuracy of Ansys simulation with the speed of generative AI”*【41:1†source】. It uses proprietary deep learning models to learn from existing simulation data and then rapidly predict the outcomes of new design configurations. Uniquely, SimAI takes the *geometry/shape* of a design as direct input instead of requiring predefined parametric variables【41:1†source】. This allows it to handle **non-parametric and variable topology** cases – the user simply uploads a 3D model, and the AI predicts performance (producing outputs like field distributions, curves, or scalar metrics) within minutes【41:2†source】,【41:2†source】. In downstream testing, SimAI has shown **10×–100× speedups** across all design phases for computation-heavy projects【41:2†source】. By **democratizing simulation** through an intuitive web interface and no-code workflow, it makes advanced simulations accessible to non-experts and enables far more design iterations under tight time-to-market constraints【41:1†source】,. 

These capabilities open new **AI-centered development possibilities** in engineering. For example, product teams can integrate SimAI into generative design loops – using AI to propose design variations and SimAI’s learned model to evaluate each in near-real-time. This means an autonomous **AI agent** could iteratively brainstorm a design (e.g. an aircraft wing shape or microchip layout), simulate its performance via SimAI, and refine the design based on results, all without human intervention. Indeed, early users report that SimAI *“enables exploring more technical possibilities during early design, reducing overall time-to-market”*【41:1†source】. The platform’s open ecosystem (it accepts **Ansys or non-Ansys data** for training) also hints at integration with external AI tools – for instance, connecting SimAI with an optimization algorithm or a reinforcement learning agent that seeks optimal configurations. In short, SimAI’s **combination of speed, accuracy, and accessibility** provides the foundational “environment” needed for agentic AI in engineering: AI-driven agents can now rapidly test hypotheses in simulation, enabling **adaptive design workflows** far beyond traditional human-paced iteration【41:1†source】.

## Technology Stack and Architecture of SimAI (AWS-Based) 
Under the hood, SimAI is built as a **cloud-native microservices** solution, primarily hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for scalability and security. An Ansys blog post (June 25, 2024) notes that *“the SimAI platform is architected on AWS”* in alignment with AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices【41:2†source】. The platform is **multitenant** and runs on containerized infrastructure managed by **Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)**, with each customer’s jobs isolated on ephemeral compute instances for security【41:2†source】. Data (such as training datasets and generated models) is stored in **Amazon S3** with end-to-end encryption (in transit via TLS 1.3 and at rest with AWS KMS keys)【41:2†source】,【41:2†source】. For computation, SimAI leverages AWS EC2 instances (including GPU instances for deep learning) with the AWS Nitro hypervisor to ensure strong tenant isolation and near bare-metal performance【41:2†source】. Authentication and user access are handled via an enterprise-grade identity service – the platform can integrate with a customer’s Identity Provider for single sign-on, enforcing role-based access control for each tenant’s workspace【41:2†source】.

**Programming stack:** Job postings and Ansys documentation in 2025 confirm that SimAI’s services are largely implemented in **Python** and utilize modern frameworks. A July 2025 job listing for a full-stack engineer notes *“expertise in Python development with FastAPI”* (a high-performance Python web API framework) and familiarity with C++ for certain components【41:4†source】. This suggests that the backend APIs and possibly AI model serving routines are written in Python (leveraging libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow for the deep learning models), with some performance-critical modules or legacy integration in C++. The same listing highlights experience with **Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration**, plus cloud deployment on AWS (or Azure) and a microservices/DevOps mindset【41:4†source】. A **DevOps engineer** posting (circa 2025) specifically mentions maintaining the “SimAI SaaS platform” using tools like **Pulumi/Terraform (Infrastructure-as-Code)**, AWS services, Kubernetes, and scripting in Python/Bash. All these indicate a **modern SaaS architecture**: infrastructure defined as code, continuous integration/deployment pipelines, containerized services, and automated scaling on the cloud. The front-end is a web application (likely a JavaScript/TypeScript single-page app or integrated via FastAPI templates) that communicates with backend APIs. Additionally, a **Python SDK (PySimAI)** is provided for power users to script interactions; this SDK is part of the PyAnsys ecosystem and allows uploading data, triggering model training, and requesting predictions programmatically【41:2†source】,. 

**Summary of current stack:** In production as of 2024–2025, SimAI runs on AWS with **EKS/Kubernetes**, using **Python** (FastAPI + deep learning libraries) for core services, **AWS S3** for data, **EC2** for compute with GPU and Nitro isolation, and IaC tooling (Terraform/Pulumi) for managing cloud resources. This stack was chosen for reliability and maturity – each component (Kubernetes, AWS cloud services, etc.) is proven at scale, aligning with the delivery requirement to avoid immature tech. The result is a robust platform where simulation AI models can be trained and served securely at scale, and which can integrate with external tools via REST APIs or the Python SDK.

> **Tech Stack Alternatives:** If one were to implement a similar platform from scratch, common **alternative stacks** might include a Java or C# microservices architecture, or a Node.js/TypeScript approach. For instance, one could build the backend in **Java Spring Boot** or **.NET Core**, containerize it and deploy on Kubernetes, and use Java-based ML frameworks (or call out to Python for training tasks). Another popular approach would be using **Node.js** with frameworks like NestJS for the API and leveraging JavaScript ML libraries or again offloading heavy AI computations to Python services. Each of these stacks would likewise interact with cloud services (whether AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) for storage and compute. However, given Ansys’ focus on deep learning and the available talent/tools in the AI domain, Python-based cloud microservices were a natural fit – aligning with three common enterprise tech pillars: **Python + Kubernetes + Cloud**, **Java/C# + Kubernetes + Cloud**, or **NodeJS + Cloud**, with the first being the one Ansys adopted.

## Integrating Agentic AI with SimAI 
To **develop agentic AI** on top of SimAI, we consider how autonomous AI “agents” can be woven into the simulation workflow. According to AWS’s prescriptive guidance (Aug 2025), *“Agentic AI represents the convergence of autonomous software agents and generative AI”*, combining goal-driven decision making with the language understanding of LLMs【41:3†source】. These agents can **observe**, **reason**, and **act** in an environment asynchronously and autonomously【41:6†source】. In the context of SimAI, an agent could take on the role of a **“digital engineer”**, automating tasks that a human would normally do via the SimAI UI or SDK. Several integration patterns are possible:

- **Tool-Based Agent:** In AWS terminology, SimAI’s API can be a “tool” for an AI agent【41:6†source】. For example, an agent powered by an LLM (Large Language Model) could be prompted with a high-level goal (e.g. *“Optimize this component’s design for minimal weight while maintaining strength”*). The agent would then autonomously call SimAI’s APIs as a tool: uploading candidate geometries, invoking predictions, and analyzing the results to decide the next action. The agent uses SimAI much like a human engineer would – as a fast evaluator of designs – but it can iterate far more rapidly and systematically. 

- **Workflow Orchestration:** Agentic AI can also be embedded at the process level. One could design a **workflow agent** that coordinates multiple steps: e.g. first an agent generates a design (perhaps via a generative model or by modifying an existing design), then triggers SimAI to predict performance, then a decision step evaluates if criteria are met, looping until an optimum is found. This aligns with the *“workflow orchestration agents”* pattern where an agent manages a sequence of tasks or calls to other services , . With SimAI drastically cutting simulation time, such orchestration can happen in near real-time.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** For very complex design problems, one could employ multiple specialized agents in a collaborative fashion. AWS notes that multi-agent systems can involve agents with distinct roles (planner, evaluator, critic, etc.) negotiating and sharing information toward a goal , . In a SimAI-enhanced scenario, one agent might propose design variants (using domain-specific generative logic), another agent (the “simulator agent”) queries SimAI for each variant’s performance, and a third agent aggregates results or focuses on constraint checking. They communicate through a shared memory or messaging system to converge on the best design . SimAI here serves as the **common test-bed** enabling this emergent collaboration – a pattern AWS explicitly calls *“simulation and test-bed agents”* in its agentic AI framework【41:6†source】.

- **Natural Language Interface:** Another integration is adding a conversational **AI Assistant** (like a chatbot in the SimAI UI) powered by LLMs (e.g. AnsysGPT). This assistant can be seen as an agent that interacts with the user in natural language, and under the hood it can execute SimAI operations. For instance, the user might ask *“Compare the drag coefficient for these two wing designs”* and the AI assistant would translate that into SimAI actions: retrieving or running predictions for each design and summarizing the comparison. This agent acts as an intelligent UI layer, making SimAI even more accessible. (Ansys has indeed launched a virtual assistant called **AnsysGPT** in 2024 to answer support questions; we can imagine future versions also controlling SimAI workflows on the user’s behalf.)

In all these scenarios, key **considerations** must be addressed: governance and safety (the agent should operate within allowed bounds – e.g. avoid trying extremely out-of-scope designs without oversight), traceability (we need to log the agent’s decisions and SimAI calls for debugging and trust), and multi-tenancy (if multiple agents run for different users or projects, ensure they don’t interfere or leak information). These align with recommended best practices for operationalizing agentic AI, such as enforcing **guardrails, identity, and observability** for agent actions【41:3†source】. With SimAI already built on a secure, multi-tenant cloud foundation, it provides a solid base to add an agent layer on top.

## Optimal Architecture Proposal (AWS Cloud with AI Agents) 
Building on the existing AWS-based SimAI deployment, the **optimal architecture** for integrating agentic AI would add components that enable autonomous agents while leveraging stable, production-ready technologies. The design should remain **“well-architected”** (reliable, secure, efficient, cost-optimized) and target near-term deliverability (using mature services available by 2025, not speculative tech). Figure 1 outlines the proposed architecture on AWS, with the new agent-related components highlighted:

 ,【41:2†source】*Figure 1: High-level architecture for SimAI with integrated AI agents (AWS cloud, 2025). The SimAI core (in blue) uses AWS-managed Kubernetes (EKS) for training and inference microservices, with data on S3 and model compute on EC2 GPU instances【41:2†source】,【41:2†source】. New agentic AI components (in green) include an Agent Orchestrator service and associated AWS managed services to provide a robust, scalable multi-agent environment .* 

- **User Interface Layer:** End-users (engineers or designers) interact via a *Web Application* (the existing SimAI web UI) or a *Chatbot Interface*. The web app still allows users to upload data, configure AI training, and request predictions manually. The new conversational interface (chatbot) is powered by an LLM (large language model) and enables users to issue high-level requests in natural language (e.g. “Please optimize this design for weight under 100N load”). This AI assistant is essentially an agent front-end; it passes user intents to the backend **Agent Orchestrator**.

- **Agent Orchestrator Service:** This is a central new microservice responsible for managing one or more AI agents to fulfill a given task. It receives goals (from the UI/chat or other triggers) and coordinates agents’ reasoning and actions. Implementation-wise, this service can be a Python-based component (for easy integration with LLM APIs and SimAI SDK), possibly built with an agent framework (such as LangChain or Semantic Kernel) but hardened for production. It might use **AWS Step Functions** or an async task queue (e.g. SQS) under the hood to sequence complex agent workflows with timeouts and retries . The Orchestrator will invoke an LLM (through a managed service like **Amazon Bedrock** or an OpenAI API) to power the agent’s reasoning. Importantly, the Orchestrator is where we enforce **guardrails**: e.g. limiting how many iterations an agent can run, validating agent-generated inputs (so that obviously invalid geometries aren’t sent to SimAI), and ensuring compliance with enterprise policies.

- **LLM and Tools for Agents:** The cognitive engine for each agent is a Large Language Model. In AWS, an optimal choice by 2025 is to use **Amazon Bedrock** (which provides access to various foundation models, including AWS’s Titan or Anthropic’s Claude, fully managed) or **Amazon SageMaker** endpoints for a custom fine-tuned model . The agent’s *tool use* is crucial: one of its primary tools is the **SimAI API** (for uploading a design and running a prediction). Other tools might include knowledge base queries (if the agent needs domain knowledge or previous results, it could query a **Vector Database** or use an **OpenSearch** index of past simulations as its memory ). In our architecture, we include a **Vector Store/Knowledge Base** (for example, an Amazon DynamoDB or OpenSearch service) that the agent can use to store and retrieve information during its reasoning – such as remembering which designs have been tried and what their outcomes were. This contributes to the agent’s short-term and long-term memory.

- **Core SimAI Services:** The existing SimAI platform components remain largely as-is (blue in Figure 1). The **SimAI Training Service** handles users’ model training requests: it launches training jobs in the EKS cluster, likely utilizing GPU nodes, and stores the trained surrogate models (possibly in S3 or a model registry database). The **SimAI Prediction Service** takes a new geometry and a selected trained model to produce predicted results. This service is highly optimized for speed, running inference on containerized microservices in Kubernetes. Both of these interact with the **Data Storage** (Amazon S3 buckets for simulation datasets and model artifacts)【41:2†source】. Also part of core SimAI is the **Web App Backend** (FastAPI servers) which serves the UI and provides RESTful endpoints (this includes endpoints that the Agent Orchestrator will call as a client, e.g. an endpoint to run a prediction or retrieve results).

- **Security & Identity:** We continue to leverage AWS Identity and Access Management and the existing SSO integration for users. The agent components themselves run server-side within the trusted environment. Each agent execution can be tied to a user identity or API key so that normal authorization applies – this ensures an agent can only access data or trigger simulations that its user could. AWS’s identity federation and token-based auth (via Cognito or custom JWT issuers) would be utilized so that the Agent Orchestrator when calling SimAI APIs does so on behalf of a user with scoped permissions. Communication between services is over TLS within the VPC, and sensitive data stays encrypted (just as SimAI’s data storage is encrypted, any vector store or logs are also encrypted at rest).

- **Observability & Monitoring:** Since agentic systems can be complex and nondeterministic, robust monitoring is critical. We integrate **Amazon CloudWatch** for centralized logs and metrics from all services (including agent decision logs, SimAI usage metrics, errors). For tracing multi-step workflows, AWS X-Ray can be used to trace requests as the Orchestrator calls the LLM, then SimAI, etc., to get an end-to-end picture of each “agent session.” We also implement **custom monitoring** within the Agent Orchestrator: e.g. counting how many iterations an agent has done, how many SimAI calls, tracking the confidence values returned by SimAI, and so on. These help detect if an agent is stuck or going out-of-bounds. Alerts can be set (via CloudWatch Alarms or Amazon EventBridge events) to notify engineering teams if an agent misbehaves (e.g. loops excessively or produces anomalous outputs).

- **Integration & Workflow:** The overall flow might work as follows for an optimization agent: The user provides a goal through the UI or an API. The Agent Orchestrator spins up an **agent instance** (logically – this could just be a coroutine or state machine within the service, not necessarily a separate process for each agent) and uses the LLM to devise a plan. The agent then calls SimAI Prediction Service via its API (the Python SDK could be used here inside the Orchestrator code) to evaluate a candidate design. SimAI returns results in seconds, the agent analyzes the results (perhaps comparing against the goal), and decides the next step. This loop continues, possibly generating new designs (for which the agent might need a strategy – e.g. using an algorithm or even writing code: we address this in *Extensions*). Once the agent is satisfied or a certain number of iterations reached, it produces a final recommendation or design output to the user. Throughout, all actions are logged and intermediate results could be stored (e.g. in the vector memory or a temporary S3 path).

**Why this architecture is optimal:** It builds upon SimAI’s proven AWS-based design and introduces AI agent capabilities using AWS services that are **readily available and mature by 2025**. We avoided any bleeding-edge, unproven frameworks by using established services: Amazon Bedrock for managed LLMs (GA in 2023), Step Functions and SQS (well-proven orchestration and messaging), and standard AWS monitoring tools. The use of Kubernetes (EKS) remains, as SimAI already relies on it – this avoids re-engineering the training/inference system. The extension with an Agent Orchestrator service is a **modular addition** that doesn’t destabilize existing components; it can be developed and deployed independently, following the microservice approach. Moreover, this design supports **scalability** (multiple agents can run in parallel, benefiting from AWS’s auto-scaling on EKS and Bedrock’s scalability) and **multi-tenancy** (the Orchestrator can enforce that each customer’s agents operate in isolation, possibly even running in separate Kubernetes namespaces or with separate config to ensure data separation). By aligning with AWS’s own reference architectures for agentic AI (which emphasize event-driven, modular agent services)【41:3†source】, , this proposal ensures that the SimAI+agents system can be delivered as an enterprise-grade, secure, and maintainable product.

## Microsoft Azure-Only Architecture Alternative 
For organizations that standardize on Microsoft Azure, a similar SimAI-with-agents solution can be implemented using **Azure’s cloud services** exclusively. The core concept (containerized microservices for the simulation AI, and an agent orchestration layer) remains the same, but we substitute Azure equivalents for each component:

- **Compute and Orchestration:** Instead of AWS EKS, we use **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** to deploy the SimAI services (training, inference, web API) in containers. AKS would manage scaling of pods for training and prediction jobs. Azure offers GPU-enabled VM nodes for AKS to handle the deep learning tasks, comparable to AWS EC2 GPU instances. The agent orchestrator service can also run as a container or Azure Function. For workflow orchestration, Azure’s **Durable Functions** or **Logic Apps** could replace AWS Step Functions to manage multi-step agent workflows with reliability (Azure Durable Functions allow implementing long-running orchestrations with retries, which is useful for agent loops).

- **Data Storage:** Use **Azure Blob Storage** (with Data Lake Storage Gen2 if needed) in place of S3 for storing simulation datasets, trained model files, and results. Blob Storage supports encryption at rest and TLS in transit; we’d enforce similar encryption and access control policies as on AWS. Additionally, any vector database or memory store for agents could be implemented with **Azure Cognitive Search** (which can serve as a vector search engine for embeddings) or **Azure Cosmos DB** if a NoSQL store is needed for agent memory. Cosmos DB with its API for MongoDB or Cassandra could store JSON context or intermediate results by agent.

- **Identity and Security:** For user authentication and identity integration, **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** is the centerpiece. SimAI’s web app would use AAD for SSO (many enterprise Azure customers would prefer that). The multi-tenant separation can be enforced via AAD tenant IDs or resource groups – each customer’s data can be isolated in separate storage containers and Kubernetes namespaces, with Azure RBAC ensuring only that customer’s identity can access their resources. Azure offers **Managed Identities** for services, which we’d use to let the agent orchestrator securely call other Azure services (for example, the orchestrator container can have a managed identity to access an OpenAI service resource or storage). For network isolation, we deploy resources in an Azure Virtual Network; AKS supports network policies to segregate traffic, and we can use an Application Gateway or Azure API Management as a secure entry point for the web UI and API calls.

- **AI and Agents:** The equivalent of Amazon Bedrock on Azure is the **Azure OpenAI Service**, which provides access to GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other models in a fully managed way (with data privacy) – this became generally available in 2023 and is a mature option by 2025 for enterprise LLM needs. Our agent orchestrator on Azure would call Azure OpenAI to get the LLM-powered reasoning. Azure OpenAI can also host fine-tuned models or allow few-shot prompting as needed. For agent memory or knowledge integration, Azure provides **Azure Cognitive Services** for knowledge base Q&A and **Azure OpenAI embeddings + Cognitive Search** for a vector index – these can be combined to give agents the ability to store and retrieve contextual info. (For example, the agent could use Azure Cognitive Search to find similar past designs from an indexed repository when making decisions.)

- **Machine Learning Services:** If we wanted to avoid managing our own training infrastructure on AKS, we could leverage **Azure Machine Learning** service for training the SimAI models. Azure ML allows submitting training jobs to Azure compute clusters (with GPUs) and managing model artifacts in a registry. However, given SimAI’s highly integrated nature (with custom training code and need for quick inference), it might be simpler to stick with AKS for both training and inference jobs for consistency. Azure ML could still be used to track experiments or if a GUI for training runs is desired.

- **Monitoring and DevOps:** Azure’s monitoring stack includes **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics** which collect logs and metrics from AKS containers, Functions, etc. We would set up dashboards and alerts similar to CloudWatch. For tracing agent workflows, **Application Insights** with its distributed tracing can track calls between the orchestrator, LLM service, and SimAI APIs. We’d also leverage Azure’s DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy the container images and IaC (in Azure, we could use **Bicep or Terraform** for infrastructure definitions; since SimAI’s team uses Terraform, they can repurpose it for Azure providers). All secrets (API keys, credentials) would be stored in **Azure Key Vault** as the counterpart to AWS Secrets Manager.

- **Architecture Adjustments:** Azure has some unique features that could enhance this solution. For instance, to achieve secure isolation of compute, Azure offers **Confidential Computing** VM options (using Intel SGX or AMD SEV) which, analogous to AWS Nitro enclaves, can ensure even stronger isolation for sensitive code (this might be overkill for SimAI, but it’s an option if customers require it). Additionally, Azure’s container registry and container instances can be used for quickly spinning up ephemeral jobs if needed (similar to how SimAI uses ephemeral EKS instances – on Azure one might use **ACI** for truly serverless container execution for short tasks). 

The **Azure-only architecture** would thus closely mirror the AWS architecture in capability. The SimAI platform would be deployed in Azure with **AKS, Blob Storage, Key Vault, and AAD** providing the baseline, and the agent layer would use **Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Search, and Durable Functions** for the AI logic and orchestration. All these Azure components are fully managed and production-hardened by 2025, avoiding any preview or experimental tech. The delivery timeline would involve mapping each AWS feature in the original system to its Azure counterpart – a feasible approach since Ansys’ design (Kubernetes + REST + Python) is largely cloud-agnostic aside from service bindings. This means switching to Azure should not require a complete rewrite, just adjusting deployment and integration points. The end result is an SimAI+Agents platform that can be offered to customers within the Azure ecosystem without relying on AWS, yet maintaining the same performance and security standards.

## Future Extensions and Enhancements 
Looking ahead, several **extensions** to the SimAI platform and its agentic capabilities are likely as the technology and user needs evolve. We explore a few high-impact areas – support for additional code, low-code interfaces, and improved observability – and propose methods to realize each:

### 1. Incorporating **Code Generation and Custom Logic** 
As AI agents become more sophisticated, they might not only use pre-built tools but also **generate custom code** to solve novel problems. In the context of SimAI, an agent could decide to write a small program or script to, say, transform input data, create a new design geometry procedurally, or post-process simulation results in a custom way. This resembles the emerging class of *“coding agents”* which leverage AI to produce and execute code on the fly【41:6†source】. To support this safely, SimAI could introduce a **sandboxed code execution environment** for agent-generated or user-provided code. For example, a secure container (with resource and permission limits) could run Python snippets that an agent writes as part of its strategy. This would allow flexible extension of functionality – e.g., if an agent determines that a certain parametric geometry should be created, it could write a short Python script using a CAD library to generate that geometry, run it in the sandbox, then feed the output to SimAI for evaluation.

Another aspect is allowing **users themselves to add custom code** in the workflow. Advanced users might want to plug in their own analysis or integrate SimAI output with other tools. Ansys could expose a **plugin API** or scripting interface within SimAI. For instance, after a prediction is done, a user-provided script could automatically calculate a specific KPI from the raw results. By exposing such hooks, SimAI becomes extensible for customized workflows. AI can assist here as well – envision a **“Copilot”** in the SimAI UI where a user describes what they want (e.g. *“Compute the average temperature in region X for each design iteration”*), and the AI generates the code to do it. The user can review and approve the code before execution. This approach has precedent in tools like Excel’s Office Scripts or MATLAB live scripts, now enhanced with AI suggestions.

To implement code integration while avoiding immature tech, SimAI can use **established sandboxing techniques**: e.g. running code in a Kubernetes mini-container with no network access and limited runtime, using existing open-source libraries for code execution security. Many cloud platforms have services for this (AWS Lambda could be one way to run user code with time and permission limits; on Azure, an isolated Functions container). By logging every execution and using small, auditable code pieces, the system maintains transparency. This extension would empower power-users and AI agents to go beyond the fixed feature set, effectively enabling a form of **AI-assisted programming** within the SimAI ecosystem.

### 2. Introducing **Low-Code / No-Code Interfaces** 
SimAI already targets non-experts by removing the need for deep simulation or coding knowledge【41:1†source】. To push accessibility further, adding **low-code or no-code interfaces** will help a broader range of users (including business stakeholders or engineers with limited programming background) harness the platform. One approach is a **visual workflow composer**: a web-based tool where users can drag-and-drop blocks representing actions (e.g. “Train model on Dataset A”, “Predict performance for Design X”, “If result > threshold, do Y”). This could be built on a BPMN-like workflow engine or using a service like Microsoft’s Power Automate (in Azure scenario) or AWS Step Functions’ Workflow Studio. By exposing SimAI operations as building blocks, users can create custom analysis pipelines without writing code. For instance, a user could visually set up an optimization loop or a parameter sweep study; behind the scenes this would configure the agent/orchestrator to run it.

Another low-code concept is **natural language configuration**. Using the LLM assistant, a user might simply describe what they want to do, and the system sets up the workflow. For example: *“Compare three designs with varying thickness and report which one has highest safety factor”*. The AI could translate this into SimAI tasks automatically. This overlaps with the agent integration discussed earlier – essentially making the agent interface so intuitive that it feels no-code to the user.

Integration with external low-code platforms can also be considered. For example, providing a **SimAI connector for popular low-code platforms** (like a plugin for Microsoft Power Apps/Power Automate or Zapier) would let citizen developers include SimAI in their applications. They could build a simple app where they upload a CAD file and get back an AI-predicted performance report, all without custom code, using the connector to call SimAI behind the scenes.

To implement low-code features, Ansys can build on existing UX frameworks. Many enterprise software providers create *workflow designers* which are essentially well-known technology now (not immature). The key is to ensure any auto-generated workflow or action is verifiable by the user (so they trust what the AI set up). Given that SimAI’s mission includes making simulation *“accessible to designers and non-experts”*, these low-code additions align perfectly and would likely drive adoption. We must also ensure that the underlying complexity is abstracted but not at the expense of flexibility – power users can still use the full API or code when needed, while casual users can achieve basic tasks with a few clicks or a sentence of instruction.

### 3. Enhancing **Observability and Trust** in the Solution 
As AI-driven decisions and autonomous agents take on more of the engineering workflow, **observability** becomes critical. Users and engineers operating the system need insight into *why* and *how* an AI agent arrived at a particular design or prediction. Also, robust monitoring helps maintain **trust and compliance**, especially in enterprise settings (knowing that the AI is doing the right things and any issues can be quickly detected). Several methods can be employed to bolster observability:

- **Traceability of Agent Actions:** Every action that an AI agent takes (calls to SimAI, intermediate decisions, tool invocations) should be logged in a structured manner. By 2025 there are emerging tools for tracing LLM-based agents – for instance, OpenAI’s function call logs or frameworks like LangChain have callback handlers for every step. We would integrate these so that for each agent session we can reproduce the sequence of steps. This log can be exposed in a user-friendly form, such as a **“decision trace” viewer in the UI**, so that an engineer can see the path the agent took (e.g. “Tried design A -> result X; then adjusted parameter Y -> tried design B -> result Z…”). This transparency is essential for debugging and trust.

- **Performance and Drift Monitoring:** SimAI’s predictive models, once trained, should be monitored for accuracy over time. As an extension, SimAI could periodically validate its AI predictions against real high-fidelity simulations (for a small sample of cases) to detect if the model’s error is increasing. Similarly, if agents are suggesting designs that consistently fail to meet goals, that feedback should loop into either retraining the model or adjusting the agent’s strategy. Setting up **automated evaluation pipelines** – for example, monthly retraining or testing – with alerts if performance degrades, will ensure the solution remains reliable. This is part of **MLOps** best practices (continuous monitoring of model quality).

- **User Feedback Loops and Explainability:** Providing users some ability to give feedback (like *“the prediction here was inaccurate”* or *“the agent’s suggestion was not feasible”*) can help improve the system. On the observability side, adding **explainable AI features** would be valuable. For instance, SimAI could highlight which areas of a geometry most influenced a prediction (using techniques akin to sensitivity analysis or saliency maps). If an agent chooses one design over another, it could present a rationale (drawn from its LLM’s reasoning chain) to the user. Though LLM reasoning can be opaque, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and summarization can produce a human-readable explanation of what the agent considered. This directly addresses stakeholder trust, as recommended by AWS’s guidance to enforce **explainability and guardrails** in agentic AI【41:3†source】.

- **System Health Monitoring:** In addition to AI-specific telemetry, the usual application monitoring must be top-notch. Dashboards for cluster health (CPU/GPU utilization, memory, queue lengths), tracking how many predictions or agent runs are happening, and their success/failure rates, help the DevOps team ensure the system is scaling properly. We might implement a **tenant-specific usage monitor** as well – e.g. each customer can see how many simulations their team ran, the average turnaround time, etc. This not only is good for transparency but also can feed into monetization or license usage tracking (aligning with business models around SaaS).

For these observability enhancements, we will use proven tech: logging frameworks (e.g. ELK stack or cloud-native log services), APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools for distributed tracing, and established XAI (explainable AI) techniques for machine learning. None of these require fundamentally new inventions – it’s about **integrating them thoughtfully** into the SimAI platform. By doing so, we transform SimAI from a black-box predictor into a **glass-box** system where users and operators can see and trust what’s happening inside, which is indispensable as agentic AI takes greater control of engineering decisions.

## Conclusion 
Ansys SimAI represents a major step toward **AI-centered engineering**, offering rapid simulation-driven insights that can be harnessed by autonomous agents for dynamic design exploration. We reviewed SimAI’s core capabilities – notably its generative AI surrogates that deliver results in minutes – and saw how they *“redefine digital engineering workflows”* by enabling expansive design searches within short development cycles【41:1†source】. The platform’s cloud-native architecture (built on AWS with Kubernetes, Python microservices, and secure multi-tenancy) provides a robust backbone for layering on **agentic AI**. By integrating AI agents, either as assistive chatbots or fully autonomous optimizers, organizations can move beyond static automation to **goal-driven AI workflows**, where software agents act as tireless digital engineers collaborating with human teams.

We proposed an optimal architecture on AWS that incorporates an Agent Orchestrator, LLM services, and AWS tooling (Step Functions, SQS, Bedrock, etc.) to manage agent reasoning in a reliable, controlled manner. For Azure-centric environments, we outlined a counterpart design using AKS, Azure OpenAI, and other Azure services – demonstrating that the vision of SimAI with agentic AI can be realized on any major cloud with the right services. Crucially, both architectures emphasize using **mature, available technologies** (circa 2025) to meet delivery timelines and avoid experimental dependencies. 

Finally, we explored likely future extensions that will keep SimAI at the cutting edge of AI-driven simulation: adding support for AI-generated **code** to extend functionality safely, introducing **low-code interfaces** to broaden user access and ease workflow automation, and strengthening **observability** with better tracing, explainability, and monitoring. Each of these enhancements aligns with industry trends and best practices. For example, providing transparency and traceability addresses the need for trust in AI (as highlighted in AWS’s August 2025 guidelines)【41:3†source】, while low-code tools fulfill SimAI’s mission of accessibility for even *“business users”*.

In summary, Ansys SimAI’s fusion of simulation physics with AI not only accelerates engineering today, but also sets the stage for **agentic AI in the enterprise** – where autonomous agents, empowered by fast and accurate simulation insights, collaborate with humans to drive innovation. By architecting the solution thoughtfully (whether on AWS, Azure, or other platforms) and planning for key extensions, we can confidently deliver a scalable, secure AI-driven simulation ecosystem. This will enable the next generation of products to be designed with an unprecedented level of automation, intelligence, and creative exploration, fulfilling the promise of SimAI as a catalyst for adaptive, intelligent engineering workflows.
