## üî¨ Research Model Integration

### What We Learned
- **Deep Research Model Success**: Azure AI's o3-deep-research model provides exceptional quality for comprehensive research tasks (20-30 minute execution times)
- **Agent Orchestration**: Successfully programmed agents to use specialized tools (DeepResearchTool) with Bing grounding for current, authoritative information
- **Research Quality**: The research model produces significantly higher quality, more comprehensive analysis than standard chat models

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Core breakthrough: Programmatic agent creation with research model
deep_research_tool = DeepResearchTool(
    bing_grounding_connection_id=conn_id,
    deep_research_model=os.environ["DEEP_RESEARCH_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"]
)

agent = agents_client.create_agent(
    model=model_deployment,  # gpt-4 for orchestration
    name=f"deep-research-agent-{job_id}",
    instructions="Expert research analyst with deep research capabilities",
    tools=deep_research_tool.definitions
)
```

### Key Insights
1. **Model Selection Strategy**: Use GPT-4 for agent orchestration, o3-deep-research for actual research execution
2. **Research Quality**: The deep research model provides citation-rich, authoritative analysis
3. **Execution Patterns**: Long-running research jobs (20-30 min) require robust monitoring and progress tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns & Design Decisions

### Unified Research Service Pattern
Created a comprehensive research service supporting multiple execution strategies:

```python
class UnifiedResearchService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executors = {
            ResearchStrategy.SIMPLE: SimpleResearchExecutor(),
            ResearchStrategy.FAST: FastResearchExecutor(), 
            ResearchStrategy.ASYNC: AsyncResearchExecutor(),
            ResearchStrategy.DEEP: DeepResearchExecutor()
        }
```

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple research execution strategies
2. **Background Processing**: Threading for long-running research jobs
